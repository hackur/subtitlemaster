this iffffffffs a utf-8 subtitle

2
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,816
Your feddddddddel more and more calm...

3
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:17,952
Now imagine a screen...

4
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,583
A movie screen that opens before you

5
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,927
Create on it any place you like

6
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:27,734
Concentrate on your breathing

7
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:31,190
Helping your body to relax...feel at peace

8
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:36,294
You don't have to change it.
Just let it come and go

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,789
Come and go...

10
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,333
Now...

11
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:45,811
You are there

12
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:48,509
Pay attention to the details

13
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,196
The colors

14
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:55,092
The textures

15
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,163
The light

16
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,923
The temperature. Feel the temperature

17
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:09,418
Allow this calm view to develop before you

18
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:15,866
The feeling of peace is infinite...

19
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:22,290
It's raining cats and dogs

20
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:24,984
Are you sure this is closed

21
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:28,465
Are you more calm now?

22
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,312
Well, is not easy.
With that view I have in front

23
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:32,520
What view?

24
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,039
I can see through your skirt

25
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:39,743
You are such a pig!
You know what, I won't read you anymore.

26
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,902
Besides, is almost time.
I'm going to pick her up

27
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:44,975
Ok, I�ll stand up and prepare some coffee

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,655
Would you like some music?

29
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,190
Ok, whatever is on

30
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,822
Ok, I�ll leave you with your Wagner

31
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:55,892
See you in a while

32
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,313
OUT TO SEA

33
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:43,777
Julia, get in the car.
You're going to freeze

34
00:02:56,527 --> 00:03:00,495
You are Gen�, right. I am Mark, hello

35
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:01,991
And Julia?

36
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:09,574
It looks like Galicia doesn't like us

37
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,854
Yeah, well, it's February.

38
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,302
How was your flight?

39
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,126
Fine. We finally meet

40
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:19,598
Would you mind coming with me in the car?

41
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:25,737
We had agreed that only one
person would come

42
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:26,757
Yes, of course

43
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:29,486
- And..?
- Oh, Mark? He's only here to take notes

44
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:33,612
- Ok. Do you trust him?
- Yes. Well...he works at the firm

45
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:37,573
Look, I�m not sure if you are aware of the step
that Ramon has to take

46
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,899
Of course I know the step Ramon has to take.
We've talked about it

47
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,676
Today it's you, then its the press, then it's the television.

48
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:46,956
Ramon is afraid that this could be taken
in the wrong direction

49
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:51,595
All I can tell you is that I�ve
come to do things as best as possible

50
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:52,931
I hope so...

51
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,235
And I remind you that for me this is really important

52
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,722
Not only professionally...

53
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:07,177
Believe me
I understand Ramon very well

54
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,799
- Hello
- Hello

55
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,759
My name is Julia

56
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,296
You are the lawyer

57
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:33,903
This is Manuela. Ramon's sister in law

58
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,454
- Do you want help?
- No, no. It's fine

59
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,647
They're here

60
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,260
- Hello
- Hello

61
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,829
Excuse me for not giving you my hand

62
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:58,860
How come?

63
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:02,876
They tell me you are a little nervous

64
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,099
- Well, let's see. The first thing is breakfast
- What time?

65
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:16,196
9:30. Don't think that I like to wake up early

66
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:23,113
- After that, I listen to the radio for bit
- What do you like to listen to?

67
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:28,442
- A little of everything. Mostly debates.
- You like debates?

68
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:31,640
Yes, yes. I like the party

69
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,119
See. This is my personal computer

70
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,416
- Did you design it?
- Yes, I like inventions.

71
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:50,831
My father or my nephew builds them

72
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,430
You are so serious all of a sudden

73
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,513
Why dying?

74
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:17,576
Well, let's see. I want to die because
for me, life in this way...is not worthy

75
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,551
I can understand if other tetraplegic could
feel offended when I say life like this is not worthy

76
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:31,854
But I don't judge anyone.

77
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:36,614
Who am I to judge those that want to live?

78
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:41,789
That's why I ask not to be judged nor the
person that helps me to die

79
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,558
And do you think someone is going to help you?

80
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:51,900
Well, that would depend on the ones taking the decision.
If they manage to conquer their fears

81
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:57,540
Is not such a big deal. Death has always been there
and always will be

82
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:04,228
In the end we all get there. All of us.
It is a part of us

83
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,322
Why are they so surprised
because I say I want to die?

84
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:11,874
As if it is contagious

85
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:19,009
If we finally go to trial, they will ask you
why you don't seek alternatives to your disability

86
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:23,042
Why do you reject the wheel chair?

87
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:29,881
To accept the wheelchair would be like
accepting breadcrumbs of what used to be my freedom

88
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:34,368
Look, you are sitting there, less than 2 meters away

89
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,912
What are 2 meters?

90
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:40,575
An insignificant trip for any human being

91
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:53,781
Well, for me, those 2 meters, necessary to get to you
and being able to touch you, is an impossible journey...

92
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:57,333
...a chimera, a dream

93
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,805
That's why I want to die

94
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,996
The three hours have passed, Ramon

95
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,021
She has to change my posture

96
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,243
Would you mind waiting downstairs?

97
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:17,099
He called us a year ago.
He wanted us to, literally, help him die

98
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:26,546
I told him that we could provide psychological help,
legal support. But we wouldn't put the cyanide in his mouth

99
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:31,850
He got very mad. He called us liars.
I had to hang the phone

100
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:36,906
A few days later he called again, more calm.
I was surprised at how decided he was

101
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,994
- He has ever hesitated?
- Never

102
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,089
That is very important

103
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:46,041
- And how long has he been like this?
- 26 years

104
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,865
His mother used to take care of him but
when she died, his sister in law took over

105
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:51,992
How do you feel?

106
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,681
Fine, this arm...a little higher

107
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,103
I'm going to change the catheter

108
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:03,759
- Not now Manuela
- Is just a moment. Let them wait

109
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,622
She is married to Jose, Ramon's brother

110
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:10,662
They live of the farm and a little orchard they have

111
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,902
And what do they think about this?

112
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,452
Ideas are free.

113
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:23,291
But I think that is not right

114
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:26,444
But why not?

115
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:30,915
I want what's best for him.
Everyone in this house wants that

116
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:35,355
Then why would he want to die?

117
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,529
I cannot get that into my head

118
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,034
Is not rational, as he says

119
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:48,023
I cannot give it to him and I don't give my
authorization to do it in this house

120
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,940
Hello

121
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:04,707
- Don't leave that there Javi!
- Oh come on mom!

122
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:06,394
Take it to your room

123
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,706
Your uncle wants you to check the machine

124
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:14,657
- The bag...
- Yes!

125
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,001
- What's wrong?
- The roller is a little stuck

126
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:32,655
- Didn't you have exam today?
- No. And the lawyer

127
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:38,853
She is with Gen� and grandpa.
He took them to the beach

128
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,918
They might end up in Corunna.
With that head of him

129
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:45,838
Don't talk like that about your grandfather

130
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,566
His mind is completely gone

131
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,357
Of course, he is old, what do you want?

132
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,565
Well, that he stays out of the way

133
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,297
He is all day at home...

134
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:56,514
As if we needed him.

135
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,096
What

136
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:15,111
Look, one day...I don't know when,
maybe in a long time...

137
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:21,767
One day you are going to regret so much, so much what you just said.
That you will want the ground to swallow you

138
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:28,178
- But why?
- One day, you'll see. One day...

139
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:37,361
Here the ocean is very treacherous.
Those who dare bathe in it, have to be very careful

140
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,594
My son jumped from here.

141
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:42,897
I don't know what he was thinking.

142
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:55,153
He jumped exactly when the water was receding
and he hit his neck against the sand

143
00:11:56,954 --> 00:12:03,082
This is very very sad.

144
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:10,777
God wants him to keep on living.

145
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:13,863
But you know that he doesn't want to live anymore

146
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,319
But, he never told me anything,
he never told me...he never told me anything

147
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:19,973
Look, we will win Heaven, because
we have spent our whole lives in Hell

148
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:32,387
I tape this image so the judges or politicians
or whoever has to decide

149
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,045
understand better...

150
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:43,723
Apparently they can't identify with the psychological pain of the person,
then maybe this way they'll understand that this is not life

151
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,274
Why do you smile so much Ramon?

152
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:50,714
When you can't escape and depend
constantly on others

153
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,201
You learn to cry by laughing

154
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:34,054
Good morning

155
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:37,070
- Does Ramon Sampedro lives here?
- Yes, what do you want?

156
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:42,188
I was taking a ride and thought
about visiting him

157
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:45,765
I heard lots of people come to see him

158
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,748
Ok

159
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,682
Just a little while

160
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,346
My name is Rosa

161
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:08,177
Come closer

162
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:19,344
Where are you from?

163
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,137
Boiro. I came on my bike

164
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,392
Oh God, I feel like such a fool

165
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,837
- Why?
- Well, because I don't know what to say. Since I don't know you

166
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:43,054
Don't worry about that. I can't do anything else.
Please, have a seat.

167
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,310
Why did you came?

168
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:58,765
You're not making it easy.
What do you do?

169
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:00,788
I work in a conserve factory

170
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,299
and I�m also a radio host at Radio Boiro,
Wednesdays and Fridays

171
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,179
- So, maybe I�ve heard you sometime
- Yes?

172
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:15,283
- But is only an amateur thing... - No,
you are pretty good - Yes, apparently, eh?

173
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:20,305
The thing is to get started, after
that no one can stop me

174
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,825
- I have 2 little sons
- Your husband?

175
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:32,672
Let's see. I had a boyfriend, the
father of my youngest son...

176
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:37,744
but he also left me...we left him.
So now I�m alone but happy

177
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:42,498
I was asking in case I had any chance...

178
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,193
Why do you laugh?

179
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:53,290
Sorry...

180
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,656
It's ok, I was joking

181
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:01,312
Besides, I don't think I�d be willing to take on
two children, I have enough with my nephew

182
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,736
I saw you on TV the other day

183
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:08,544
hmmm...see, now we are getting closer

184
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,655
Closer to what?

185
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:13,623
To the reason why you came

186
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:20,622
I heard what you said and then I saw your
eyes, that are really pretty

187
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:21,367
Thanks

188
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:26,758
And I thought, those eyes full of life!
Why would someone with those eyes want to die

189
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:32,086
Look, we all have problems sometimes and
we don't have to run away of them, you know?

190
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:38,460
- No, I don't run away of my problems...
- Yes, of course you do. That's why I wanted to come

191
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,180
What for?

192
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:44,427
To give you reasons to live

193
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:50,571
- To tell you that life...
- Life what?

194
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:56,730
Is worth it

195
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:04,809
Let's see, did you came here to
see me or to convince me?

196
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:07,112
No, I came because I want to
be your friend Ramon

197
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:10,465
If you want to be my friend, Rosa,
you should start by respecting my will

198
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:14,903
How can you be so closed?

199
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:18,824
Don't judge me. Don't judge me Rosa.
Not in my own house

200
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,312
Or do you want me to judge you?

201
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:27,079
Do you want me to judge you?
Why don't we talk about the real reason you came

202
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,006
Why don't we talk about the fact that you are
clearly a frustrated woman...

203
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:35,862
that woke up this Saturday looking for
ways of giving reason to your own life

204
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:42,094
Yes, run. You that can.

205
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:52,494
Thanks a lot.
So you don't want me to put you anything?

206
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,910
- No, dear. Just stay as cheerful. Good night
- Good night

207
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,991
Well, it's 8:45 and here we are at Radio Boiro.

208
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:04,910
I remind you that you can call
and request your favorite song

209
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:14,020
Before I continue...I would like to dedicate the
next song to someone that maybe is listening tonight

210
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,019
I know he listens to the radio a lot

211
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:22,731
I would love it for him to call me someday
and ask for a song

212
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:28,391
Although I know he won't because...the last time
we saw each other we didn't end up in good terms

213
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,962
But for what it's worth,
I�d like to tell him I'm sorry

214
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:37,018
I'm sorry I judged you Ramon, I am
such a fool and I can't help it

215
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:44,610
Enough...for you my friend, Ramon,
"Negra Sombra" (Black Shadow)

216
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,996
- Yes?
- Hello

217
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:18,836
Gen�! How are you?

218
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:23,244
Well, still at the office.
You are giving us too much work, Ramon

219
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:24,947
I'm just kidding

220
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:29,723
Hey, the report was spectacular.
We have received a lot of support calls

221
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:33,178
- This will be really great for the trial
- If you say so...

222
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:38,516
Oh, come on! You have to improve that mood,
otherwise we won't be able to do anything

223
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,307
- You knew we had to do this.
- Yes, I know, I know

224
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:47,699
Julia, the lawyer, wants to see you again
and this time for longer

225
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,211
Has she fallen in love with me?

226
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:53,291
You wish handsome!
besides, she is married

227
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,481
No, she says she needs to know you
better to prepare the case

228
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,803
That's what they all say

229
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:03,513
Wait...
2 minutes and I�m there

230
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:09,393
Hey, did you know that the guy that came
with her wants to go out with me

231
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:14,816
- Are you leaving me for a lawyer?
- No

232
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:16,920
You are missing on it

233
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,416
I see it quite well

234
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:31,865
Your leg

235
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:34,776
Well, yes..it moves

236
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:41,072
Let's see...this is going to be easy.
You only need to answer with your heart

237
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,768
With the head, you mean..

238
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:46,167
With the head.
You don't mind if I record it, right?

239
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,758
Let's begin with your youth, before your accident.

240
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:56,429
What did you do then?

241
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,165
Is that necessary?
I had forgot all about it.

242
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:03,158
Is your memory that bad?

243
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:08,260
No. I just thought we would talk about
my suicide demand

244
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:14,165
We will Ramon. Is just that is very important
that the judge identifies with you

245
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:16,179
and that he understands you.

246
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:19,699
For that I need to know who is
Ramon Sampedro and who he was

247
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,651
That way, you will use it against me later.

248
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,570
You are such a Galician!

249
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,786
- I'm your lawyer, I�m on your side
- Ok

250
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:41,857
When I was 19, I packed my things and
I went around the world

251
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:45,746
I was doing that for a couple of years,
until the accident

252
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:49,945
Wait, wait. You went around the world with
only 20 years?

253
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,800
You just don't know how.
Ship mechanic.

254
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,552
I always tell my nephew.
To travel without money, become a sailor.

255
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:01,743
What?

256
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:03,351
Looking for proof?

257
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,978
No, is that I can't see a single picture
of you around here

258
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,487
How were you in your younger years?

259
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:13,101
Why? Am I so ugly now, or what?

260
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,636
Ok, I won't ask you anything else. That's it

261
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,485
You don't like looking into the past, right?

262
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,877
Of course not, I look into the future.

263
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:34,315
- And what is the future for you?
- Death, just like for you

264
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,804
Don't you think about death?
I'm not the only one who thinks about it.

265
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:43,098
Yes, yes. Of course I think about it

266
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,613
I just try that it doesn't become
my only thought

267
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:00,132
Tomorrow is going to rain

268
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,243
Tomorrow is going to rain

269
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:24,505
I think he whistled

270
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:28,208
- I didn't hear a thing
- Yes, he did

271
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:41,457
- What do you want?
- The game already started

272
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,480
But you know I don't like soccer

273
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:47,431
Why don't you watch it downstairs

274
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,806
Hey, if you want to convince me
you need to give me a rational justification

275
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,254
The "Depor" is playing

276
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:10,644
That is not a rational justification

277
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,621
- But it is important
- Why?

278
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:17,773
Because it is decisive for the league.
If they loose this one, they can only make it to second place

279
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:21,508
OK, turn it on

280
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:28,301
- Can you see?
- Yes

281
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,272
Did you hear him whistle too?

282
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,175
Ramon told me you asked about the pictures

283
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:46,928
Yes

284
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,723
There's gotta be one somewhere

285
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:51,431
I'll look for them tomorrow

286
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:52,844
Thanks

287
00:26:54,508 --> 00:26:56,565
If you need more blankets, look in the closet

288
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:00,367
In June, it is still cold at night

289
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:01,759
Manuela...

290
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,664
- No, no, no
- Yes, yes, yes

291
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:09,774
I cannot accept this, I can't

292
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:13,277
Manuela, I�m going to stay a couple of days.
The least I can do is contribute with something

293
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,538
But added to the fact that you are
doing it for free

294
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:20,856
I'm doing this because I want to.
Manuela, please...

295
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:26,480
Ok. Anything that you need, please let me know

296
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:28,726
Thanks

297
00:27:29,768 --> 00:27:31,343
What are you plotting over there?

298
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:32,831
Nothing

299
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:39,007
It's a shame you can't see the sea from here

300
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:40,870
Is better like that

301
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:45,062
That way I can see it when I want to

302
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:48,013
How come?

303
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:57,220
When I want to, I concentrate and
take a step to the sea

304
00:27:58,621 --> 00:27:59,684
Flying

305
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:02,228
I imagine that the sea means a lot to you

306
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:06,098
Well, the sea gave me life and
then took it away

307
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:08,699
I don't know if that means anything

308
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:14,419
Give me some details about that day.
The day that your life changed, ok?

309
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:16,315
Whatever you say.

310
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,828
Ok, first...

311
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,171
...when did it happen?

312
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,949
August 23rd of '68

313
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:33,691
- You still lived with your parents?
- Yes. I was still a kid

314
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:42,603
- Were you alone at the beach that day?
- No, I was with some friends, town's folk

315
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:50,185
But how is it that someone so familiar with the sea
didn't calculate the receding

316
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:54,657
I was distracted

317
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,793
Distracted?

318
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:02,400
Yes, I was thinking about things

319
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:06,616
And?

320
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,789
Ok. Leave it alone. It doesn't matter

321
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,621
I can see you don't want to
talk about it either

322
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,612
No. I'm just remembering

323
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:59,202
When I realized I was in the air,
jumping on an almost empty pool

324
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:13,434
- Were you left unconscious?
- No. I was just there...face down

325
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:15,345
Floating

326
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:21,968
You know is true what they say about those
that are about to die

327
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:26,088
that all of a sudden you get to see the
most important moments of your life

328
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:27,951
That happened to me

329
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,111
And what did you see?

330
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,624
They say that those that drown, after all the
air has been expelled, die instantly

331
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:42,097
A sweet death.
I should have died then

332
00:31:57,007 --> 00:32:00,839
- Do you still see all this people?
- Some I do, some I don't

333
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:08,198
- Who is this girl?
- Some girl

334
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,862
Well, she appears in many pictures

335
00:32:18,218 --> 00:32:20,841
She lived in the town.
Can I have a puff?

336
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:25,631
- Do you smoke?
- From time to time in case it kills me

337
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,456
but nothing...

338
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:40,032
- She was my girlfriend
- Your girlfriend? And what happened to her?

339
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:51,123
There was a time when she used to go to the hospital.
One day she said something foolish about getting married

340
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:59,529
And I told her to get out of there, try to resume her
life the best way she could and that she should forget about me

341
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,728
But, did you love her?

342
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:06,753
That was not the issue

343
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:11,273
How come?

344
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,887
The issue was if I wanted to love her in this condition

345
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:20,704
Are you telling me you refuse to love because...

346
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:23,976
Because I can't love

347
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:25,934
Just like that

348
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:34,838
So, what I have to tell the judge is that, in your opinion,
tetraplegics have no right to fall in love

349
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:41,550
But who's talking about tetraplegics?
I'm talking about me, Ramon Sampedro

350
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:54,317
There are other ways of making love

351
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,764
Yes of course

352
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:04,788
Has any girl kissed you in the past 27 years?

353
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:12,122
Now you are going to show me how, no?

354
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,938
- The girl from Borio is here
- The girl from Borio?

355
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:23,745
- Christian, I told you to come here
- Rosa!

356
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,784
- Hi Ramon
- I told you to come here!

357
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,712
Leave him, it's ok.
Are you good or bad?

358
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,041
- Bad.
- Then we will get along fine

359
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:38,561
- I'm Julia
- I'm Rosa, nice to meet you

360
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,488
I'm sorry to have interrupted you

361
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:43,664
I'll go for a while and leave you alone

362
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,999
- How are you?
- Fine

363
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:56,091
I hope you are not here to give me some of
those reasons to live you always bring

364
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,501
No. No way.
Well, I don't know...

365
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:02,950
I wanted to see you.
And wanted you to meet my sons

366
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:04,126
That's better

367
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:10,460
Christian, behave yourself.
We are not at home.

368
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:13,564
This is Samuel.
Sami, say hello

369
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,116
Hi, Sami.

370
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:22,619
- Why are you in bed?
- Because he can't move, I already explained it to you

371
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,068
Is it true you can't feel a thing?

372
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:33,186
What happens to you now?
Are you hot?

373
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,250
Is just that with this weather you never know.

374
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:44,113
We are on strike because there's been a month
since they paid us. So it's like Sunday for us

375
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:48,912
I made the breakfast, we took the bus
and we came to see you

376
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:53,335
- What happened?
- Nothing

377
00:35:56,895 --> 00:35:58,735
Samuel, why are you crying now?

378
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:02,015
Manuela...

379
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,951
What do you think about all this?
Tell me the truth

380
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:10,486
What do I think about what?

381
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,869
That your brother in law wants to die

382
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:18,805
That�s what he wants

383
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:21,533
Ok, but...

384
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:28,708
...but you. What would you want?
What would you prefer?

385
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,493
What I prefer has no importance

386
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,227
Ramon wants to die.
Everything is quite clear for me

387
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:42,404
- Would you like to see a thing?
- A thing?

388
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:44,738
Yes, come

389
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:53,503
- Christian, leave that alone
- Leave me alone!

390
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:56,278
I'm going to leave your ass like
a ripe tomato

391
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:20,148
Almost all of them are poems

392
00:37:24,204 --> 00:37:25,725
I never threw anything away

393
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:29,996
I couldn't do it.
It takes a lot of effort for him to write them

394
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:32,013
And his handwriting...
Look...

395
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,787
I never saw such a beautiful handwriting

396
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:45,802
- Ok. I'll be downstairs
- Manuela

397
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,026
Is going to take me a while to read all of this

398
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:53,386
- Would you mind telling Ramon that...
- That you went to the beach

399
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:57,489
- ...to take a walk
- Thanks

400
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,673
Of course it is the first and the
last time I bring you here

401
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:11,440
- But mom, that guy is faking it
- The last time!

402
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:22,145
- Did she tell you when would she be back?
- Just to take a walk

403
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:24,513
That way you can take a nap

404
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,376
- You can't complain
- Why?

405
00:38:31,463 --> 00:38:35,416
Not a minute passes by that a woman
comes into this house. Are you building a harem?

406
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,230
Manuela, you know I�m only married to one

407
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,071
Yes, with Death

408
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,908
- Do you want anything else?
- No

409
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,848
They told me you were here.
And I came flying

410
00:43:31,947 --> 00:43:33,098
Manuela...

411
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:45,057
Hi

412
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,480
How was the walk?

413
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:51,489
I've been reading Ramon

414
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,169
I've been reading all that you have done.

415
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:58,920
You know what?

416
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:03,938
What you have written...

417
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,393
...is wonderful

418
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:13,920
So...you are not only a lawyer,
but also a writer

419
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:17,280
Ok. Make fun of me.

420
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:20,015
But I tell you that this can be published

421
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:23,758
Of course it can be published.
Nowadays you can publish almost anything

422
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:26,815
I don't see a better way to support your demand

423
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:30,687
Is your voice

424
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:38,508
Look Julia, this was more clear
at the beginning

425
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:44,914
You came here with a purpose, to help me

426
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:51,586
Instead of that, you start questioning everything.
Looking for reasons...

427
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:56,145
You get inside my feelings...

428
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,151
Do you want me to leave?

429
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:15,279
What I want right now is a cigarette, please

430
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,982
Sure.

431
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,046
I'll go get them

432
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,846
Julia, what happened?

433
00:46:13,745 --> 00:46:14,809
Are you alright?

434
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:21,697
Manuela!

435
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:48,645
Is not about what happened,
but about what could happen.

436
00:46:51,229 --> 00:46:56,029
Because...one day...is the legs

437
00:46:56,244 --> 00:47:00,008
But on another day...

438
00:47:01,824 --> 00:47:04,744
...you can go blind

439
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:08,575
And you can get better or not

440
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:11,840
I had been lucky so far

441
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,823
but then comes the next stroke

442
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:21,431
and the next, and the next

443
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:24,662
and no one can tell you when
or how they are going to be

444
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:28,062
No one can tell what is going
to be left of you if anything at all

445
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,309
Your husband is very optimistic

446
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:37,637
And what is it good for?
If there's not even medication for this

447
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:47,075
What's the point of standing up, working, getting your
hopes up if at the end comes the next stroke and you fall again

448
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:49,003
and you feel again like shit

449
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,713
Is ridiculous

450
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,257
I called you because I want
to become a member of DMD

451
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:07,248
I had thought about it 2 years
ago when I was diagnosed

452
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:10,967
but I backed out at the last moment

453
00:48:11,911 --> 00:48:13,030
But not after this...

454
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:16,702
...not after this.

455
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,566
I can't take it anymore.
This isn't life

456
00:48:26,998 --> 00:48:28,157
Does your husband know?

457
00:48:31,164 --> 00:48:32,805
- I don't know if I want to tell him
- You should

458
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:39,950
Fear is a very powerful weapon.

459
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:44,740
Fear doesn't give you freedom to decide

460
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:48,155
What you are telling me right now
is a product of that fear

461
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,675
Maybe, later, you will back out,
precisely out of fear

462
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:56,354
Do not act based on fear.

463
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:59,446
You are supposed to support people
that want to commit suicide, right?

464
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,514
No.

465
00:49:03,425 --> 00:49:09,205
Do you think that I go around telling people with problems
that the best is to get out of the way

466
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:17,084
No. What we support is freedom.
The freedom of those that want to live and those that want to die

467
00:49:17,192 --> 00:49:18,417
Is very different

468
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:24,519
And CADASIL is a very fucked up disease, I agree

469
00:49:26,608 --> 00:49:29,200
But I only ask that you think it a little bit more

470
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:37,552
Ramon, gave me this for you

471
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:49,014
If you want, we can talk some other day about this

472
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:00,923
How do you see her?

473
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:03,716
Fine

474
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,187
Really?
I also think she is fine

475
00:50:09,516 --> 00:50:13,891
- Ok. Nice to meet you
- Thanks for coming

476
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:15,099
You are welcome

477
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:17,810
- I'll stay a while longer
- OK

478
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:36,944
Dear Julia...When Gen� told me that a lawyer wanted my case

479
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:41,049
there was something that
influenced my decision

480
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:45,054
and it was the fact that the lawyer
suffered a degenerative disease

481
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:48,687
I thought that only someone in that
condition could really understand mine

482
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:51,270
And shared my hell

483
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:57,614
Now I know that living in that hell is sometimes
worth it, if one gets to meet people like you

484
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:03,781
Is worth it to have shared a cigarette with them

485
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:08,189
or, like right now, caressing them even if its just
by writing some foolishness like this

486
00:51:08,629 --> 00:51:11,068
And talking about foolishness,
I'm correcting my writings

487
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:13,940
With the hope that you will come soon
and give me a hand

488
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:17,851
For now, my nephew Javi is helping me
by copying them on his computer

489
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:21,246
For the rest, life continues just the same, you know

490
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:25,562
Manuela kept the whole month covering me
so next year doesn't catch me off guard

491
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:31,829
Javi keeps fighting with his grandpa and sometimes
I make up little chores so they spend more time together

492
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:36,356
This month some friends came to visit.
Some of them have been doing it for 25 years

493
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,701
and that keeps surprising me

494
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,061
They enjoy telling me their stories

495
00:51:42,387 --> 00:51:44,451
Do you remember Rosa?
The girl from the conserve factory.

496
00:51:44,796 --> 00:51:46,500
I think she found here some kind of refuge

497
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:50,930
The other day she wanted to help Manuela to
change my clothes, and they ended up arguing

498
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:56,969
I proved again that when you depend on someone
for everything, you lose your privacy

499
00:51:57,283 --> 00:52:03,683
Well...I hope to keep my little kingdom in order
until you can cheer me up with your presence

500
00:52:04,194 --> 00:52:04,970
A big hug.

501
00:52:13,393 --> 00:52:14,081
What's going on?

502
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:16,641
Let's see. What does it say here?

503
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:21,597
"No es asi la vida que va" (The life that goes is not like that)

504
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:25,710
No sir. It has to say
"No es as� la vida. Qu� va" (Life is not like that. No way)

505
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,649
- No
- Yes. And that "Qu�" has accent

506
00:52:28,905 --> 00:52:31,889
That "Qu�" has accent. Do you see it?
Right there.

507
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:36,081
"Death is my friend,"
where's the colon?

508
00:52:37,209 --> 00:52:39,425
What are they teaching you in school?

509
00:52:40,272 --> 00:52:42,095
You have to pay attention to what I give you

510
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:44,788
Even your grandpa would do it better

511
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:49,302
Look Javi, if this is the way you are going to help
I rather you didn't do it, ok?

512
00:52:49,726 --> 00:52:51,296
Because you make me work twice

513
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,839
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick

514
00:52:58,128 --> 00:53:00,430
Put a little more attention, ok?

515
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:13,949
- Javi, what happened?
- Nothing

516
00:53:31,796 --> 00:53:34,707
Dear Ramon...please forgive me for taking so
long in answering your letter

517
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:40,946
But the doctors have limited me the use of the computer
and in general, any activity that doesn't make me use my legs

518
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:45,665
They assure me that I�ll be able to walk again
but they say that I shouldn't continue with your case

519
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:50,121
In the physical therapy room there's a huge window

520
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:55,449
Sometimes I imagine that I go through it and fly,
like you, over Barcelona

521
00:53:56,088 --> 00:54:00,009
I reach the sea and keep flying until I can only
see that endless line of water

522
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:07,304
And think, foolish me, that if you do the same
from Corunna, maybe you'll go around the world again

523
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:10,831
And we end up finding each other in
some part of the planet

524
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:16,303
I identify with you when you mention
the lack of freedom and privacy

525
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:21,235
I try to bear with it, mainly for my husband
that takes care of me with much dedication

526
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,901
But at the same time, I refuse to fall
into this inertia

527
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,746
where I just can be grateful for what is given because
I have no other choice but to accept it

528
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:31,797
I wish I�ll be able to see you in a couple of months

529
00:54:32,029 --> 00:54:34,085
And I keep my promise of helping you
with the book

530
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:38,988
Until then receive the thanks and
a hug from a very good friend

531
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:47,502
I knew this could happen, I knew it.
We are going to have to try again

532
00:54:48,006 --> 00:54:50,670
No Mark, how can you say
that we have to try again?

533
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,065
As if justice is so swift in
this country

534
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:10,508
No. And now it is me the one
that has to tell him

535
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:35,038
The demand of the tetraplegic Ramon Sampedro requesting the euthanasia
was rejected yesterday by the tribunals due to defects in its form

536
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:38,909
The sentence says that the judicial process
should have been started in Corunna

537
00:55:39,493 --> 00:55:42,494
where he resides, and not in Barcelona

538
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:49,162
Many voices have been raised due to this case
among them is priest's Francisco de Galdar

539
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:50,692
tetraplegic like Ramon

540
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:54,626
Ramon says he doesn't want to
live anymore, but I wonder

541
00:55:55,395 --> 00:56:03,057
isn't it possible that Ramon is asking of society,
of all of us, some kind of attention

542
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:04,713
What is he talking about?

543
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:10,841
Maybe is that the people that surround him doesn't
provide the love or support that he needs

544
00:56:11,649 --> 00:56:12,505
That moron

545
00:56:13,313 --> 00:56:16,632
Couldn�t it be possible that what Ramon is
asking is for more love?

546
00:56:17,393 --> 00:56:24,620
I would really like to talk to him and convince him
that there are many reasons to keep on living

547
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:27,135
Aren't you going to school?

548
00:56:36,846 --> 00:56:38,279
I hope you are happy now!

549
00:56:39,726 --> 00:56:41,110
Our whole family humiliated
on television

550
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:47,302
But keep it up, keep it up.
Until our faces fall out of embarrassment

551
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,445
And you dad? Aren't you going to tell him anything?

552
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:54,249
Don't involve dad in this.
Whatever you have to tell me, do it and be done with it

553
00:57:03,095 --> 00:57:06,236
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

554
00:57:06,308 --> 00:57:08,328
Listen to me, listen to me for a moment

555
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:10,444
What if you have an accident tomorrow
and you die?

556
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,010
Have you thought about it?

557
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:19,618
What would happen to me?
I would have to take care of the family, right?

558
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:24,674
Of your wife, your son, dad...
With that miserable pension of mine

559
00:57:25,826 --> 00:57:29,497
If I stay alive, I�ll make
things a lot more difficult

560
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:34,978
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

561
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:39,896
I am the older here. And while I�m alive,
no one is getting killed here

562
00:57:40,447 --> 00:57:43,440
No one in this house is getting killed.
Put that in your head, Ramon

563
00:57:43,863 --> 00:57:44,807
No one!

564
00:58:12,094 --> 00:58:15,852
- Ok, son. I'll leave
- See you tomorrow dad

565
00:58:35,435 --> 00:58:36,467
I'll go

566
00:58:39,451 --> 00:58:40,995
Hi Manuela, I came to see Ramon

567
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,378
But, do you know what time it is?

568
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:46,545
I know. I couldn't come sooner.
I'll explain it to Ramon

569
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:50,748
I don't think he's in the mood of visits.
He had a bad day

570
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:53,265
Why don't you come tomorrow?
Or the day after?

571
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:54,513
It's important

572
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,468
The conserve factory is closing

573
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:02,099
That things are not going well.
That there's no money to pay us

574
00:59:02,827 --> 00:59:04,066
And that we are fired

575
00:59:04,386 --> 00:59:06,428
There's no right, damn it!

576
00:59:06,463 --> 00:59:07,391
There's no right.

577
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:13,767
- Forgive me Ramon
- I have nothing to forgive

578
00:59:14,886 --> 00:59:18,870
Cry all you want.
I wish I could stand up and give you a hug

579
00:59:22,616 --> 00:59:24,830
Now that I had started to save some money

580
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,862
I wanted to buy you a telescope
for the day of the Wise Men

581
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:30,901
You don't have to buy me anything, Rosa

582
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,126
I will get really mad if you spend one cent on me

583
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:34,877
But I really wanted to

584
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:41,365
- I wanted to give you something
- But why do you have to give me anything?

585
00:59:42,188 --> 00:59:44,796
Because you game me a lot Ramon,
you have no idea

586
00:59:52,283 --> 00:59:54,762
No man has never been so kind to me
as you have been

587
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:57,051
Was it that bad?

588
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:07,842
Now, I don't complicate things

589
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:11,874
Now I know that the problem must be me, right

590
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:15,738
That men doesn't like me or something

591
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,864
What do you say, Rosa?
How is that even possible?

592
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:23,696
Wasn't that what you told me when I came
here the first time?

593
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:25,792
Frustrated woman, you said

594
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:33,928
Yes, yes. If I called you that then,
now I call you strong and brave

595
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:39,306
and kind and beautiful. And I call an imbecile
to those who can't see it

596
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,502
Rosa, please stop it.

597
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:48,445
You make me feel like a priest and
I hate them enough already

598
01:00:48,718 --> 01:00:50,821
Sit over here, come on sit.

599
01:00:56,645 --> 01:00:59,032
And leave my hand alone, you know I can't feel it

600
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,596
My son says you are faking it.

601
01:01:11,698 --> 01:01:14,955
But you do feel your face, right?

602
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:35,993
I wish I could help you.
I would do anything to help you.

603
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:38,289
You would help me?

604
01:01:38,537 --> 01:01:39,761
Yes

605
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:46,464
Don't worry. I have it all planned
so that no one ends up in jail

606
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:49,990
I have some friends that are willing to help

607
01:01:51,512 --> 01:01:54,695
I only need one more.
Someone brave, like you

608
01:01:54,984 --> 01:01:58,448
No.

609
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:01,519
Help you heal...

610
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:05,438
not die

611
01:02:19,132 --> 01:02:22,699
Come un guys, let's go.

612
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,060
Are you holding him?

613
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,307
He won't fit through here

614
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,658
Ramon says that he understands the situation
but that he won't come down

615
01:02:56,929 --> 01:02:59,465
Ok. It doesn't matter.
Brother Andres

616
01:03:04,688 --> 01:03:07,960
Go upstairs and tell Ramon

617
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:21,942
...and since we are inside eternity.
Life doesn't belong to us...

618
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:27,872
and we take to ridiculous extremes the
bourgeois definition of private property

619
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:31,157
You are killing me

620
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:35,421
But if Church was the first one in
secularize the private property

621
01:03:37,405 --> 01:03:38,608
- I can't tell him that
- How come?

622
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,487
Should I tell him that?

623
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:51,626
Freedom to choose my beliefs...no, his beliefs
and decide over his life

624
01:03:53,214 --> 01:03:54,766
Ok, now you tell him

625
01:03:57,446 --> 01:04:00,974
Why does the Church keep with such passion
that posture of terror of death?

626
01:04:01,573 --> 01:04:04,269
Because it knows that it would lose
a great amount of its customers

627
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:06,701
if people lose their fear to the
Great Beyond

628
01:04:07,493 --> 01:04:13,789
He reminds you that according to the polls,
67% of the Spanish are in favor of euthanasia

629
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:18,100
Very well, very well. Now you tell him
that moral issues are not resolved through polls

630
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,003
Because most of the German people was
also in favor of Hitler

631
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:25,612
Now he is going to compare me to Hitler.
That is very rude

632
01:04:26,203 --> 01:04:27,075
No, not that

633
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:31,859
Ask him what does Hitler has to do with anything

634
01:04:32,863 --> 01:04:38,298
No wait...
Padre Francisco, do you hear me?

635
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:41,818
Yes. Ramon I can hear you

636
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,346
Why do you mix pears with apples?

637
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,553
I hope you didn't come here to do demagoguery.

638
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,256
Because you Jesuits know a lot about that.

639
01:04:50,585 --> 01:04:52,282
No, no. Of course not.

640
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:55,512
But since you bring up demagoguery, my dear Ramon.

641
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:01,479
Don't you think that what's really demagogic is
to say "Death with dignity"

642
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,094
Why don't you leave the euphemisms aside and
call things by its name, with all its rawness

643
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:08,679
"I take my life" and that's it...

644
01:05:09,758 --> 01:05:15,607
It keeps surprising me your interest in my life,
when the Institution that you represent

645
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:23,029
accepts the death penalty and condemned for centuries
to the bonfire those who didn't think in the right way

646
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:25,496
Now it is you the one doing demagoguery

647
01:05:25,597 --> 01:05:30,269
Yes of course, but leaving the euphemisms aside, as you say
that's what you would have done with me, right?

648
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:32,140
Burn me alive

649
01:05:32,884 --> 01:05:34,812
Burn me for defending my freedom

650
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:36,923
Ramon, my friend...

651
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:38,131
Friend?

652
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:41,475
Ramon, my friend. A freedom that
eliminates life is not freedom

653
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:43,868
And a life that eliminates freedom is not life either

654
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:47,620
Don't call me friend!
And leave me alone

655
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:54,740
Come on. Let's go

656
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:05,813
You...you that look like kind people,
give this man reasons to live

657
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:12,888
Prove to him that life is not only
moving your arms and running around

658
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,820
or kicking a ball.
Damn it! Life is something else, really

659
01:06:18,852 --> 01:06:22,292
Life is so much more.
Hear it from me.

660
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:28,051
And what do you want us to do?

661
01:06:28,299 --> 01:06:30,347
That we gag him so he doesn't talk?

662
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:33,746
Or that we put him to sleep with a
rattle like a little kid

663
01:06:36,874 --> 01:06:41,226
Look. you appeared on TV and
something that I can't take out of my head

664
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:42,890
Manuela, leave it alone

665
01:06:43,312 --> 01:06:46,568
You said that Ramon's family didn't
give him enough love...

666
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:51,105
you should know that in this house no one
stopped loving Ramon for one single day

667
01:06:51,552 --> 01:06:52,392
Not one day

668
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:59,512
I've been looking after him for many years
and I love him like a son

669
01:07:03,822 --> 01:07:05,799
I don't know which one of you is right

670
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:11,219
And I don't know if it's true what you say
about life belonging to God and not to us

671
01:07:13,344 --> 01:07:15,174
but I do know one thing

672
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:18,541
you have a very big mouth

673
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:42,163
Rosa, I told you that is not
necessary. I already shaved Ramon

674
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:44,370
Yes, yes. But I know a better way

675
01:07:48,642 --> 01:07:49,619
Where do you have the soap?

676
01:07:52,683 --> 01:07:53,490
They're here

677
01:08:07,394 --> 01:08:10,456
I don't feel anything.
Are you sure there's a child in there?

678
01:08:10,816 --> 01:08:12,153
7 months old, darling

679
01:08:13,401 --> 01:08:15,621
- Well, he's not moving
- You're the one that doesn't move

680
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:17,472
- Now, now, now
- See

681
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:21,680
- He's happy to see you
- How are you going to call him?

682
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:23,816
We still don't know

683
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:29,254
Well, call him Ramon and that way one day
when he asks why, you can tell him my story

684
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:31,574
Is better if you tell him

685
01:08:37,622 --> 01:08:40,182
There's someone else who will
be really happy to see you

686
01:08:45,806 --> 01:08:49,181
- No, no. Not like that
- Grandpa, shut up

687
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:02,939
- How come you didn't say anything?
- We wanted to surprise you

688
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:05,963
This a great Wise Men's day present

689
01:09:06,135 --> 01:09:08,370
I'm going to open the windows,
it's really hot in here

690
01:09:08,675 --> 01:09:10,867
We better get out and
leave you alone for a while

691
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,578
How are you sailor?

692
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,905
- Do you drink coffee Mark?
- Yes, please

693
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:32,954
- How are you Rosa?
- Fine

694
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:35,481
Ramon told me that you had found a new job

695
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:38,144
Yes, caring for some elderly people

696
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,335
Does that woman is going to stay long?

697
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:46,503
A couple of weeks, depending on how
long the book takes

698
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:52,015
Well, I guess I won't be able to shave him.
See you some other time

699
01:09:52,303 --> 01:09:53,341
Bye Rosa

700
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:57,702
Ok, the judges have their hands
tied because of the legislation

701
01:09:58,885 --> 01:10:01,265
We are going to try to
obtain a statement

702
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:05,361
where we recommend to the government
changes to the penal code

703
01:10:05,713 --> 01:10:08,577
- The government?
- The government is there to serve us, Javi

704
01:10:08,874 --> 01:10:10,057
Your uncle is more important

705
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:13,824
The jury will not dare agree with us,
we already know that

706
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:17,176
But we cannot fail on the
regional audience

707
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:22,975
Javier, help me with the cows

708
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:35,302
We have to convince the judges that
Ramon is complete sane and lucid

709
01:10:36,318 --> 01:10:39,293
It would help us a lot
if he would make a declaration

710
01:10:39,797 --> 01:10:43,333
Manuela, we have to take Ramon
out of the house

711
01:10:46,253 --> 01:10:48,205
Can you tell me what were
you doing in there?

712
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:51,565
Do you know what are they talking about?
What they want?

713
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:53,900
And what do I do?
Lock myself up in the room?

714
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:55,693
Do you understand what they really want?

715
01:10:58,396 --> 01:11:00,164
What happens if he wins the trial?

716
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:07,170
Your uncle gets injected and dies, like a dog.
And you never see him again

717
01:11:08,028 --> 01:11:09,346
You will never see him again, Javier

718
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:11,398
Or do you think death is so great?

719
01:11:12,806 --> 01:11:14,662
Please use your head

720
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:17,045
Death is a very serious thing, you hear me?

721
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:20,593
- Your uncle dies and you won't see him again.
- Leave me alone

722
01:11:27,966 --> 01:11:31,033
Is not that he doesn't feel like it, he
just doesn't want to use the chair

723
01:11:32,685 --> 01:11:36,180
Taking him out of the house once or twice
a year is an accomplishment

724
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,540
Well, this one has to be one of those times.
It is very important that Ramon takes this trip.

725
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:43,868
And when would that be?

726
01:11:45,307 --> 01:11:48,012
I estimate that the trial will take place in the spring

727
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:50,499
So we still have time to propose it to him.

728
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,234
There's only one thing worse than the death of a son

729
01:11:56,706 --> 01:11:58,394
and that is he wanting to die

730
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,832
Well, let's get to work

731
01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:24,049
"...get inside of you, eternally,
my seducer lover, beloved sea"

732
01:13:27,065 --> 01:13:29,009
Can you really smell the sea from here?

733
01:13:29,234 --> 01:13:31,784
Yes, and sometimes in the morning if there's wind

734
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:37,056
and the window is open,
I can smell it as if I was there

735
01:13:38,432 --> 01:13:39,672
You have a very good nose

736
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:44,416
Smells are probably what cause me
more intense sensations

737
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:47,670
More fantasies

738
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:53,126
...your smell, for example.

739
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,151
My smell

740
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:04,606
Yes, is the first thing I imagine when
I day dream about you

741
01:14:07,137 --> 01:14:08,193
Really?

742
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:13,082
- And what are those dreams about?
- Just things

743
01:14:15,672 --> 01:14:17,873
They all have one thing in common...

744
01:14:19,015 --> 01:14:21,443
In all of them I can move...

745
01:14:23,494 --> 01:14:30,778
and I stand up and travel wherever
I imagine you are at that moment

746
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:35,558
And if I imagine that you are here, for example

747
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:40,383
I just get close to you

748
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:45,461
And do what I have been
wishing to do so many times

749
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:51,093
Then your smell becomes
stronger and I get dizzy

750
01:14:53,013 --> 01:14:58,571
I can feel your heart beat
then I feel your hands

751
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:05,332
And then I lose my mind...
I lose my mind

752
01:15:37,904 --> 01:15:38,994
Is the water ok?

753
01:16:01,038 --> 01:16:02,206
Julia...

754
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,173
Julia, are you awake?

755
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:09,581
Yes

756
01:16:12,092 --> 01:16:12,997
I can't sleep

757
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,060
Why is that

758
01:16:19,004 --> 01:16:21,956
I have an itching in one leg,
can you come and scratch it?

759
01:16:23,108 --> 01:16:23,955
...the leg

760
01:16:43,603 --> 01:16:45,115
I brought him some "filloas"

761
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:48,602
- I know he likes them - Rosa,
please listen -I made them

762
01:16:50,217 --> 01:16:55,007
I've told you that you don't have to cook him
anything, or bathe him or shave him. Nothing

763
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:56,679
I take care of Ramon.
Get it?

764
01:16:58,887 --> 01:17:02,606
- Ok, then I want to hear it from him
- No, he already told me

765
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,982
Besides, he is very busy now.

766
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:09,334
Is he with her?

767
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:19,950
I wish I was a lawyer too.
But of course...

768
01:17:28,636 --> 01:17:32,596
- Don't cry Rosa, don't cry
- If you don't want to see me, please tell me

769
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,124
- Of course I want to see you
- It doesn't look that way

770
01:17:36,547 --> 01:17:37,787
Really, what are you...

771
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:42,283
Rosa...
Rosa...

772
01:17:43,995 --> 01:17:45,018
She hung up

773
01:17:48,115 --> 01:17:51,721
Do you mind dialing the number again
and giving me a minute alone

774
01:18:04,336 --> 01:18:06,744
What's going on between you two, Ramon?

775
01:18:11,037 --> 01:18:12,333
But Julia...

776
01:18:14,628 --> 01:18:16,564
Why would I need to explain anything to you?

777
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:21,859
I don't understand why you answer me like that,
because then I don't know what I�m doing here.

778
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,886
Unless of course, you think that there's
nothing happening here

779
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,327
The kiss you gave me yesterday meant nothing?

780
01:18:33,886 --> 01:18:35,126
Look at you

781
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:38,918
Look at you sitting there

782
01:18:40,822 --> 01:18:42,278
Look at you

783
01:18:43,429 --> 01:18:45,494
And now look at me

784
01:18:48,045 --> 01:18:49,783
Where are we going Julia?

785
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,181
Look at us

786
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:56,189
I haven't finished

787
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,876
What do you think?

788
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:02,922
That I don't think about what happened to me?

789
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:06,930
Of course, I think about it. Frequently.

790
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,651
Every single day. It's like a nightmare.

791
01:19:14,722 --> 01:19:18,474
And I know that it will only get worse and worse
until I end up like a vegetable

792
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:22,730
So I have reached a conclusion and I rather...

793
01:19:32,048 --> 01:19:33,330
I'm going to do it Ramon.

794
01:19:37,304 --> 01:19:39,748
I'm going to take my own life

795
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:54,403
But before I do it, if you want to, my love...

796
01:19:57,187 --> 01:19:59,634
I would like to help you.

797
01:20:04,745 --> 01:20:06,288
Leave together...

798
01:20:12,665 --> 01:20:16,425
You don't say anything?
You didn't expect this.

799
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:21,584
When?

800
01:20:24,008 --> 01:20:28,631
I don't know. We are almost done
with the book and...

801
01:20:31,103 --> 01:20:38,886
I'll go to Barcelona and look for an editor
so you can publish it.

802
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:47,646
And then I�ll come back with the first copy.
That same day, Ramon. That same day.

803
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:53,227
Listen to me, in the worst case scenario
we would win the public support.

804
01:20:53,468 --> 01:20:55,907
If the verdict is negative the
discussion will be more heated

805
01:20:56,293 --> 01:21:00,362
- Don't be stupid...I can't
understand... - Are you ok? - Yes, Yes

806
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:03,250
News, what news?

807
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:09,825
Mark, please be careful. It's ok, it's ok.
What happened Ramon?

808
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:11,292
We are here.

809
01:21:13,555 --> 01:21:18,788
I understand Ramon, I understand.
But that doesn't matter

810
01:21:19,035 --> 01:21:26,491
Listen to me, if no one takes this step. If everyone hides their
heads and doesn't even try to confront the state, the judges...

811
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,528
And what do we do now Manuela?
I mean, with the trip to Corunna.

812
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,833
Do I go there and waste my time?

813
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:49,145
Knowing that they won't listen to me.

814
01:21:49,608 --> 01:22:01,199
Well, I think that today it is a waste of time but
maybe tomorrow it could be useful for someone else

815
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:14,121
Ok. Let's go and see those judges in the face

816
01:22:19,508 --> 01:22:22,444
- Javi, where is the chair
- The chair?

817
01:22:23,445 --> 01:22:25,150
I don't know, it's probably in the back.

818
01:22:25,484 --> 01:22:31,148
Well, I want you to take it out and clean it up. Then bring
grandpa and I�ll explain. We are going to make some changes

819
01:22:33,235 --> 01:22:34,963
Are going to put a motor?

820
01:22:34,987 --> 01:22:38,868
- You have to cut here and here
- Let the back move, right?

821
01:22:39,156 --> 01:22:47,388
You have to cut these pipes down here and then join them
with bolts so they move as hinges. Are you getting this?

822
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:50,324
- Yes, yes
- And you dad?

823
01:22:50,515 --> 01:22:54,915
Your going to be lying down son.
You might fall sleep at the trial

824
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,892
Is not like they're saying anything interesting, dad.

825
01:23:15,713 --> 01:23:17,241
Die to Live

826
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:21,747
LETTERS FROM HELL

827
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:24,438
You should put a pillow here
to support my head

828
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:27,370
In case I fall backwards and break my neck

829
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:33,129
Hey, Javi. Do you get it? Break
my neck... Break my neck...

830
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,808
Grandpa

831
01:23:49,576 --> 01:23:52,832
Look, if you're going to help me like that,
is better if you do nothing

832
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:15,085
- Am I tying you too tight?
- You're asking me?

833
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,965
Wait a moment please.
Ramon

834
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:28,805
Manuela, please.
As if I don't look ridiculous enough

835
01:24:29,092 --> 01:24:30,844
Better this than catching a cold

836
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,651
And don't you dare, taking it off

837
01:24:42,242 --> 01:24:43,882
You are Ramon Sampedro, right?

838
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:48,050
I really wished it was me the
one to take you.

839
01:25:50,071 --> 01:25:54,504
Living is a right,
not an obligation!

840
01:25:54,505 --> 01:25:59,476
- Look at all the people here
- Who did we kill, eh?

841
01:26:00,426 --> 01:26:04,882
Ramon, do you feel alone because you
are the only Spanish to have requested euthanasia?

842
01:26:05,162 --> 01:26:11,922
Yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
But this has been happening for many years.

843
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,257
What do you expect from the judges?
What are you going to tell them?

844
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:20,880
I just want to tell them that
I�m completely sane and lucid

845
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:24,069
Silence

846
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:30,789
Can we talk later?

847
01:26:31,564 --> 01:26:32,677
Silence, please

848
01:26:34,971 --> 01:26:38,763
In a state declared as lay and that recognizes
the right to the private property

849
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:43,899
and which constitution expresses also the right
not to suffer tortures or degrading treatments

850
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:48,651
is correct to say, that whomever sees his position as
degrading, as in Ramon Sampedro's case,

851
01:26:49,561 --> 01:26:51,746
should be able to decide over his own life

852
01:26:52,075 --> 01:26:57,154
in fact, no one that attempts suicide
and survives is judged afterwards

853
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:03,033
but...
when you need the help of someone else

854
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:07,617
to die with dignity, then the state interferes with
the freedom of the people and tells them

855
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:10,713
that the life they are living is not theirs,
that they can't make decisions about it

856
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:15,008
This, Your Honor, can only be done based on
metaphysical beliefs, or religious

857
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:18,975
In a state, I repeat...

858
01:27:20,216 --> 01:27:22,071
that is declared lay

859
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:28,015
Your Honor, I ask for a legal answer,
but above all, rational

860
01:27:28,759 --> 01:27:30,310
and human

861
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:38,740
And now, with your permission,
Ramon Sampedro would like to read something

862
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:41,717
Overruled

863
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:46,158
My client want to address you directly so you
hear from his own voice...

864
01:27:46,389 --> 01:27:49,028
You know perfectly well the process

865
01:27:49,644 --> 01:27:52,165
Of course I know it, I know it perfectly

866
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:57,492
But I didn't know that it was so irrelevant
for you to give three minutes of your time

867
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:58,227
Three...

868
01:27:59,468 --> 01:28:01,715
To listen to a man that has been waiting
for 28 years

869
01:28:01,892 --> 01:28:04,020
If you want to change the process...

870
01:28:04,323 --> 01:28:05,675
change the laws

871
01:28:06,892 --> 01:28:08,635
Yes, of course.
I know that already.

872
01:28:09,962 --> 01:28:11,771
This case is ready for a sentence.

873
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:28,657
Well...I knew you were not going
to take it seriously.

874
01:28:29,484 --> 01:28:34,080
That's what all men do. Laugh at me.
You were not going to be different

875
01:28:34,337 --> 01:28:38,776
Rosa, forgive me. Is just that lately
a little of everything happens to me

876
01:28:40,512 --> 01:28:42,079
- And...I�m a little overwhelmed.
- Why?

877
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:45,224
Is not allowed to fall in love
with a tetraplegic or what?

878
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:46,600
Is it that weird?

879
01:28:48,206 --> 01:28:54,447
Well, maybe we should clear up some things.
Specially if we are talking about something as complex as love.

880
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,439
- Complex?
- Yes Rosa, complex.

881
01:28:56,943 --> 01:29:03,646
No matter how much you tell me that you love me,
I will never be sure of how real is your love

882
01:29:03,925 --> 01:29:09,433
or if it's just an idealization of a man you wanted
to find but couldn't or didn't last.

883
01:29:09,605 --> 01:29:13,317
But what are you talking about Ramon?
Don't try to confuse me

884
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:17,924
Either you love or you don't.
You can't rationalize love

885
01:29:21,766 --> 01:29:25,340
Well, if that's the case, what do you want me to do?
You want me to move in with you?

886
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:28,493
For me is enough to know that
I can visit you from time to time

887
01:29:28,782 --> 01:29:31,301
Of course you can.
Of course you can

888
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:34,861
Yes, but for how long?

889
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:39,772
Rosa. You wouldn't ask me
to stay alive for you, right?

890
01:29:41,157 --> 01:29:42,884
What if I told you that...

891
01:29:47,444 --> 01:29:49,316
that you give me strength to live Ramon

892
01:29:49,692 --> 01:29:52,563
Wait wait. Stop this thing for a moment

893
01:29:53,635 --> 01:29:54,875
Sit over there.

894
01:29:58,923 --> 01:30:03,811
- Let's see. Do you love your children?
- Of course I do.

895
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:06,850
Well, there you have the strength to live

896
01:30:07,481 --> 01:30:10,033
Don't give me that responsibility Rosa

897
01:30:10,258 --> 01:30:14,689
Is that what you call love?
Keep me here against my will?

898
01:30:15,537 --> 01:30:16,736
Look...

899
01:30:17,904 --> 01:30:22,464
The person that really loves me is
the one that will help me die.

900
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,158
That is love, Rosa

901
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:35,895
Dear Julia...yesterday I received the sentence
of the provincial audience

902
01:30:36,607 --> 01:30:42,699
the judges understand that I want to die, but
remind me that to help me, would be punishable by law

903
01:30:43,222 --> 01:30:46,118
In other times, this would have affected me a lot

904
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:51,047
Pushing me into that alley without exit where
days and nights never end

905
01:30:51,925 --> 01:30:56,820
But now I feel that everything is rushing by
and that the publication of the book will happen any day now

906
01:30:58,221 --> 01:31:01,448
And with it you will return Julia.
My Juliet...

907
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:05,228
It will be the sweetest death that I could ever imagine

908
01:31:05,436 --> 01:31:07,677
It will be love, pure and shared

909
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:12,596
And it will be the return to balance.
Finally to balance

910
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:14,891
A kiss, my dear friend

911
01:32:12,057 --> 01:32:13,436
Ok, see you later

912
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,812
Should I open it?

913
01:32:28,956 --> 01:32:30,484
Is the book!

914
01:32:32,593 --> 01:32:35,410
Look, is the book.
You are on the cover

915
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:43,804
It smells great

916
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:51,650
Is for you

917
01:32:55,634 --> 01:32:56,945
I'm going to show it to mom

918
01:33:27,485 --> 01:33:35,541
Why...why...
why can't I be happy with this life?

919
01:33:35,717 --> 01:33:37,750
I'm going to give you a tranquilizer

920
01:33:37,838 --> 01:33:41,366
Why do I want to die?
Why do I want to die?

921
01:33:52,436 --> 01:33:53,685
Give me two more Manuela.

922
01:33:54,317 --> 01:33:56,524
Manuela, for crying out loud, two more
pills are not going to kill me

923
01:33:56,866 --> 01:33:57,995
Give me two more

924
01:34:04,673 --> 01:34:05,964
You'll feel better soon

925
01:34:48,862 --> 01:34:52,054
- How do you feel?
- Fine

926
01:34:53,493 --> 01:34:54,639
What time is it?

927
01:34:54,901 --> 01:34:57,633
11:00 am. I didn't want to wake you up today

928
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,365
The girl from Boiro has called three times already

929
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,868
What did she want?

930
01:35:05,612 --> 01:35:08,388
She says she has to talk to you about
something important

931
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:13,915
- For her it is always important
- Dial the number for me please

932
01:35:15,067 --> 01:35:17,762
Are you going to call her?
Why don't you wait for her to call back?

933
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:22,050
But she can barely pay her phone bill.
Dial the number please

934
01:35:24,707 --> 01:35:27,890
Of course Ramon.
You always so kind

935
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:36,897
- Ramon?
- What's going Rosa?

936
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:40,136
I need to see you. I have to talk to you

937
01:35:40,553 --> 01:35:44,522
- You said I should call you before visiting you
- Yes. Did something happened?

938
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,152
Can I come now?

939
01:35:48,887 --> 01:35:54,219
Look Ramon, you said you had a plan or something

940
01:35:55,810 --> 01:36:00,394
That you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do,
if the judges decided against you

941
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:02,297
Yes, Rosa, but I already asked you to
forgive me, right?

942
01:36:02,603 --> 01:36:03,882
I told you to forget about it

943
01:36:04,249 --> 01:36:05,754
Yes.
But I can't

944
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:07,249
I can't, you know

945
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:14,488
Because last month the audience said no.
And you are still thinking about doing it

946
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:17,888
Is that what worries you?
That I get my way?

947
01:36:18,977 --> 01:36:22,001
- So, are you going to do it?
- Is not that easy, Rosa. But don't worry

948
01:36:22,768 --> 01:36:24,625
You will be the last person to find out.

949
01:36:32,608 --> 01:36:33,815
Ramon...

950
01:36:35,431 --> 01:36:41,951
Is that I realized...
I understood what you said in Corunna.

951
01:36:43,102 --> 01:36:46,398
"The person that really loves me will
be the one to help me"

952
01:36:46,782 --> 01:36:49,486
I'm completely sure about what I feel Ramon

953
01:36:50,598 --> 01:36:52,406
I love you

954
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,269
Do you want me to help you?

955
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,661
Rosa...

956
01:37:03,516 --> 01:37:09,243
I'm not joking Ramon.
Do you want me to help you?

957
01:37:14,179 --> 01:37:17,186
But what are you going to tell him?
Jose wait...

958
01:37:20,755 --> 01:37:22,419
Did you hear me!
I will not allow this

959
01:37:22,658 --> 01:37:26,649
And what are you going to do?
Strap me to the bed?

960
01:37:28,339 --> 01:37:31,241
Or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills
like they used to do at the hospital?

961
01:37:31,505 --> 01:37:33,220
- No one is going to prevent me of getting out of here
- I will

962
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:34,780
- Not even you
- I will

963
01:37:35,188 --> 01:37:36,524
Will see about that!

964
01:37:36,804 --> 01:37:38,651
Or is it that I mean nothing in this house?

965
01:37:39,101 --> 01:37:41,284
I am the older brother
I am the head of the family

966
01:37:41,725 --> 01:37:44,035
Do you think that means anything to me?

967
01:37:45,543 --> 01:37:46,644
At my age?

968
01:37:47,427 --> 01:37:50,994
For me what counts is what people have in their
heads, and you have nothing in yours

969
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:56,507
I will not be a slave of your ignorance
anymore or of your prude conscience

970
01:37:56,689 --> 01:37:59,363
An what about me?
I am also a slave

971
01:38:00,529 --> 01:38:02,858
How do you think I felt when I left the sea?

972
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,537
All my life here, living out of this
fucking orchard

973
01:38:08,104 --> 01:38:10,784
To be with you.
To be only with you

974
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,929
Me, my wife and my son.
All slaves!

975
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:36,549
- Hello
- Hello

976
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:42,507
- Your uncle is going to Boiro
- Boiro?

977
01:38:43,466 --> 01:38:44,794
What for?

978
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:47,674
To spend some time there, he says

979
01:38:48,857 --> 01:38:51,594
He's leaving with that woman, Rosa

980
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:58,401
- Are they getting married?
- No they're not

981
01:39:06,201 --> 01:39:07,384
What is that about you leaving?

982
01:39:09,159 --> 01:39:10,200
For how long?

983
01:39:12,567 --> 01:39:14,608
I want to give you my book.
It's over there.

984
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:22,462
- But aren't there any more, or what?
- Yes of course, but that one is the first copy

985
01:39:24,447 --> 01:39:25,863
Open it at the bookmark

986
01:39:28,637 --> 01:39:32,181
- "To my son"?
- Yes. Read it please.

987
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:35,062
To my son

988
01:39:36,038 --> 01:39:38,341
Forgive me son for not being born

989
01:39:38,885 --> 01:39:40,469
It wasn't my fault to leave you behind

990
01:39:41,485 --> 01:39:44,317
It were the roses the ones afraid

991
01:39:45,236 --> 01:39:47,396
Forgive me for not had been able to play with you

992
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:50,917
I don't know if you were born after I passed

993
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:52,949
Remember always that I still love you

994
01:39:53,837 --> 01:39:56,324
Give a kiss to your mother from me

995
01:39:56,526 --> 01:39:57,862
And don't keep any resentments towards me

996
01:39:58,214 --> 01:39:59,175
Is not good to hate.

997
01:39:59,758 --> 01:40:00,879
So...did you get it?

998
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,277
- Yes
- Let's see

999
01:40:04,358 --> 01:40:11,813
Well, it's about a son you never had and
this is like you are speaking to him

1000
01:40:12,821 --> 01:40:14,596
And you ask for forgiveness for not having him

1001
01:40:15,308 --> 01:40:17,082
Ok. But what did I added down there?

1002
01:40:20,636 --> 01:40:24,675
- "To Javier"
- So? - So what?

1003
01:40:26,196 --> 01:40:28,122
Don't you see what I�m trying to say?

1004
01:40:29,938 --> 01:40:31,458
But I�m not your son

1005
01:40:31,746 --> 01:40:33,107
Of course not...

1006
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:36,267
But if I�m dedicating you that poem,
is for a reason, no?

1007
01:40:39,794 --> 01:40:41,378
But I�m not your son

1008
01:40:41,674 --> 01:40:45,996
I don't know what is that they teach you at school.
Get out of here. Get out.

1009
01:40:46,886 --> 01:40:48,429
You are all so weird

1010
01:40:55,628 --> 01:40:58,459
Ramon? How are you?
Wait a moment, I can't hear you

1011
01:41:01,306 --> 01:41:05,378
- Tell me dear
- I'm leaving tomorrow

1012
01:41:05,635 --> 01:41:08,116
Yes, Rosa told me this afternoon.
I'm sure you are impatient

1013
01:41:08,546 --> 01:41:09,251
A little

1014
01:41:10,371 --> 01:41:14,242
Hey Ramon, I�ve been researching
about that thing you know...

1015
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:17,641
- What? - Well that
thing... - The powder?

1016
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:25,745
Yes, the powder. You have to calculate an exact dose of 200 mg.
But it is probable that it is a little painful...just so you know.

1017
01:41:25,945 --> 01:41:35,976
Gen�. I think is best if you forget about all this.
It worries me that someday you could be implicated in this.

1018
01:41:37,143 --> 01:41:44,655
In fact, that's why I�m calling, I want to
say good bye and we shouldn't talk again

1019
01:41:45,303 --> 01:41:49,007
Is for your security.
You shouldn't even talk to Mark about this.

1020
01:41:51,591 --> 01:42:01,069
- Yes, yes. I understand. So this is farewell.
- Is better this way

1021
01:42:03,253 --> 01:42:08,093
Ok, ok...ok.
Let me tell you something...

1022
01:42:08,845 --> 01:42:12,123
Ramon, think it through all the times that is necessary.

1023
01:42:12,372 --> 01:42:21,051
Don't feel pressured. I mean, don't do it to set an example
or to not disappoint the public, or us or the association

1024
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:25,322
No one is pushing you to do it,
do you understand me?

1025
01:42:28,778 --> 01:42:32,899
- Do you understand me Ramon?
- Not you too, Gen�, please

1026
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:45,865
- I'm sorry Ramon
- Goodbye Gen�

1027
01:42:47,968 --> 01:42:50,903
Have a nice journey, partner.

1028
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:34,371
Good bye Manuela...

1029
01:43:39,076 --> 01:43:40,642
and you Javi, please be good

1030
01:43:41,371 --> 01:43:43,611
I understood what you meant with the poem

1031
01:43:46,907 --> 01:43:48,005
Come here a moment

1032
01:43:53,084 --> 01:43:54,211
Give me a hug

1033
01:44:15,865 --> 01:44:18,007
Do me favor.
Take care of your grandpa

1034
01:44:24,743 --> 01:44:26,182
Well Ramon, here we go.

1035
01:44:44,494 --> 01:44:46,421
Can you close the door, kid?

1036
01:44:59,915 --> 01:45:01,243
Come on, close it.

1037
01:45:43,046 --> 01:45:44,863
What are you going to do in Boiro chief?

1038
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:49,678
I'm going to the beach.
For a change of view.

1039
01:45:50,439 --> 01:45:53,253
A change of view? That's great

1040
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:16,130
This is the best I could find with the money you gave me.

1041
01:46:16,532 --> 01:46:19,547
And I told them about the view.
Do you like it?

1042
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:25,243
- Where do I sign? -
What for? - To marry you.

1043
01:46:30,682 --> 01:46:32,178
He fell asleep

1044
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:35,218
Of course.
Since I don't move at all.

1045
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:53,391
Ramon. If there's really life after death...

1046
01:46:55,799 --> 01:46:58,750
I know this is going to sound foolish, but...

1047
01:47:01,087 --> 01:47:03,943
- Please send me a sign?
- A sign?

1048
01:47:04,176 --> 01:47:11,759
Anything. I never was scared of spirits.
I will be very alert. Waiting. Will you do it?

1049
01:47:12,053 --> 01:47:13,750
Of course.

1050
01:47:14,061 --> 01:47:28,148
But, between you and me, I think that after we die
there's nothing. Just like before we are born. Nothing

1051
01:47:30,756 --> 01:47:32,740
How can you be so sure Ramon?

1052
01:47:33,075 --> 01:47:34,308
No one knows that

1053
01:47:34,532 --> 01:47:36,052
No I�m not sure.

1054
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:45,491
Is just a feeling. Is like when my father
looks at the sky and says "Tomorrow is going to rain" and it does

1055
01:47:46,802 --> 01:47:48,858
Is a feeling.

1056
01:47:52,251 --> 01:47:56,530
But there's something you shouldn't forget.
I'm going to be in your dreams

1057
01:47:57,770 --> 01:48:03,307
I'm going to come at night to your bed
and we will make love

1058
01:48:03,681 --> 01:48:06,568
And in case I don't tell you in your dreams
I tell you now

1059
01:48:09,121 --> 01:48:15,129
Thanks Rosa, from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks

1060
01:48:31,944 --> 01:48:38,601
Judges, political and religious authorities.
What does dignity mean to you?

1061
01:48:39,656 --> 01:48:45,616
Whatever the answer of your conscience
know that for me, this is not a worthy life.

1062
01:48:47,184 --> 01:48:51,351
I would have liked to at least die with dignity

1063
01:48:51,695 --> 01:49:00,023
Today, tired of the institutional laziness,
I see myself forced to do it in hiding, like a criminal

1064
01:49:00,215 --> 01:49:03,111
You should know that the processes conducting to my death

1065
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:09,398
has been carefully divided in small actions that do
not constitute a crime by themselves

1066
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:13,077
and have been executed by several friendly hands

1067
01:49:13,278 --> 01:49:16,564
if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers

1068
01:49:16,693 --> 01:49:21,981
I would suggest that you cut their hands, because
that is all that they contributed

1069
01:49:22,588 --> 01:49:26,548
The head, I mean the conscience was provided by me

1070
01:49:27,628 --> 01:49:31,236
As you can see, to my side I have a
glass of water

1071
01:49:31,923 --> 01:49:35,755
that contains a dose of potassium cyanide

1072
01:49:37,179 --> 01:49:39,483
when I drink it I will cease to exist

1073
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:44,331
relinquishing my most precious property. My body

1074
01:49:45,873 --> 01:49:51,354
I believe that living is a right
not an obligation, as has been in my case

1075
01:49:52,089 --> 01:50:00,784
forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years,
4 months and some days

1076
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:08,320
After all this time I make a balance of the
road traveled and I can't account for the happiness

1077
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:15,528
Only the time that passed against my will,
during most of my life

1078
01:50:16,863 --> 01:50:19,399
will be my ally from now on

1079
01:50:20,263 --> 01:50:32,605
Only time and the evolution of consciences will decide
one day if my request was reasonable or not.

1080
01:51:07,163 --> 01:51:08,667
Well...

1081
01:51:18,504 --> 01:51:20,082
It's hot...

1082
01:52:36,394 --> 01:52:40,812
- And Mark, is he coming?
- He is with our son on the beach. He loves the sea

1083
01:52:41,732 --> 01:52:44,065
- They can't be thinking about getting in
- No! It's too cold

1084
01:52:44,123 --> 01:52:46,032
- How are you?
- Fine

1085
01:52:48,691 --> 01:52:51,864
- Is she going to understand me?
- Yes...

1086
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:58,416
- I mean, does she still follow conversations and such
- Yes, yes. Sometimes is a little difficult, but..

1087
01:53:00,574 --> 01:53:04,845
- Well...I'll go see her, see you later
- See you later

1088
01:53:20,805 --> 01:53:22,030
Hello Julia

1089
01:53:24,005 --> 01:53:26,148
Hello. How are you?

1090
01:53:27,244 --> 01:53:32,068
- Fine, and you?
- Well...here

1091
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:41,075
You have a very nice house. Very beautiful

1092
01:53:46,858 --> 01:53:49,081
Well, you know that Ramon left me many letters.

1093
01:53:49,306 --> 01:53:53,738
I think that he had fun leaving
writings around after he died

1094
01:53:55,049 --> 01:53:57,009
The thing is that the other day

1095
01:53:57,386 --> 01:53:59,425
I found this letter for you.

1096
01:54:06,121 --> 01:54:07,793
Ramon who?

1097
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,895
Ramon Sampedro...
Your friend

1098
01:54:19,024 --> 01:54:22,182
I introduced you two.
Do you remember?

1099
01:54:25,167 --> 01:54:26,894
You?

1100
01:54:27,991 --> 01:54:29,630
Yes

1101
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:51,717
It's very nice in here.

1102
01:55:00,603 --> 01:55:02,970
Out to sea,
Out to sea

1103
01:55:03,467 --> 01:55:05,123
And in the weightlessness of the bottom

1104
01:55:05,283 --> 01:55:06,531
where dreams come true

1105
01:55:06,948 --> 01:55:09,365
two wills come together to make a wish come true

1106
01:55:10,068 --> 01:55:11,236
Your look and my look

1107
01:55:11,877 --> 01:55:13,588
like an echo repeating, without words

1108
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:15,877
Deeper,
Deeper

1109
01:55:16,332 --> 01:55:18,900
beyond everything through the blood and the bones

1110
01:55:20,347 --> 01:55:21,483
But I always wake up

1111
01:55:21,746 --> 01:55:23,459
and I always wish I�d be dead

1112
01:55:24,108 --> 01:55:25,611
to stay with my mouth

1113
01:55:25,996 --> 01:55:27,195
entangled in your hair
